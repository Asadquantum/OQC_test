# OQC Technical Test - Algorithm Developer
I provide 4 jupyter notebooks for 4 parts of the test.

For first 3 parts, I provide module files which include the function definitions.

For the last part, I only provide the jupyter file.

## Solution format
Solution jupyter notebooks are formatted as follows:

1. Intuition for solution,
2. Algorithm for solution,
3. Python code for solution.
